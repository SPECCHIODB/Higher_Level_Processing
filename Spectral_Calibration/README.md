## Dependencies

### SPECCHIO

We use the SPECCHIO Spectral Information System for two purposes:

1. As a database used for storing the spectral calibration data 
2. The SPECCHIO API give us SPECCHIO java class functionality from inside MATLAB

For more information on SPECCHIO see https://specchio.ch/

### JControl

The JControl package is needed in order to use the SPECCHIO API in MATLAB. This can be found here: https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15580-using-java-swing-components-in-matlab
